# Pediatric Extrapolation Dashboard

In pediatric drug development, matching pediatric exposures to adult exposures of drugs is a common approach for dose selection in pediatric patients when efficacy conclusions in adults are partially or fully extrapolated to pediatrics. The extrapolation of efficacy from adults to pediatric patients relies on the assumptions that 1) the course of the disease and 2) the response to the investigational drug are sufficiently similar between the adult and intended pediatric population (Mulugeta, Y. et al. J Clin Pharmacol 56, 1326-1334, doi:10.1002/jcph.744 (2016)).

This shinyapp is designed to help drug developers effectively communicate and make decision on exposure matching and dose selection in pediatric patients before conducting a pediatric study, when adults data and PK model are available but pediatric data is yet to be generated.
